# 🔐 NextAuth Role-Based Authentication (Mock Project)

This project is a **practice project** for learning and implementing **role-based authentication and authorization** using **Next.js App Router** and **NextAuth (Credentials Provider)**.

The focus of this project is to understand:
- How authentication works with NextAuth
- How to manage **user roles (admin / user)**
- How to protect routes and UI based on roles
- How to structure authentication-related code cleanly and scalably
